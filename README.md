Jammming Example Solution and Next Steps
Codecademy’s solution to Jammming.

To check your own work, or if you get stuck, you can download the Jammming Example Solution Code. To run the app successfully, you’ll need to npm install, add your own Spotify API Client ID to src/util/Spotify.js, and start the Create React App server.

Remember, your solution may not look exactly like ours. What matters is the functionality of your application and the readability of your overall code.

Congratulations on building a full front-end web app!

Potential new Jammming Features
Now that you’ve completed Jammming, you can also start to add new features to it. Expanding your project features is a great way to practice building new React components, learning more about interacting with the Spotify API, and maintaining your code as your app becomes more complex.
